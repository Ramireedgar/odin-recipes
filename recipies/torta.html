        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>9 pounds boneless pork butt</li>
            <li>4 dried chipotle chili peppers</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>20 Roma tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>
            <li>12 Mexican bolillo rolls, lightly toasted, cut in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>2 pickled jalapeno peppers, sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix the 16 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of minced oregano, 2 teaspoons of salt, and pepper in a bowl. Rub garlic mixture over the pork butt, and place pork in a shallow roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue roasting until pork is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 20 minutes before rough chopping or shredding it. Reserve pan drippings.</li>
            <li>Place the chipotle peppers in a bowl, and cover with hot water. Allow peppers to soak until softened, about 3 minutes; drain. Set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in 8 cloves of minced garlic and the chopped onions; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Roma tomatoes, 1 cup of water, chipotle chili peppers, 5 teaspoons of oregano, sugar, and salt to taste. Add the reserved pan drippings. Simmer, uncovered, over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Pour the chipotle sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the sauce right in the skillet. Strain the sauce through a sieve.</li>
            <li>To serve: Hollow out the bottom half of each bolillo to make a shallow bowl for the chopped pork. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the chipotle sauce over the bottom of each roll, then arrange the chopped pork over the sauce. Top each sandwich with a couple slices of pickled jalapeno, followed by the top half of the roll. Pour about 1/4 cup of additional chipotle sauce over the entire sandwich.</li>
        </ol>
